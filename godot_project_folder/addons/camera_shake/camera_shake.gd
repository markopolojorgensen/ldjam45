# warning / disclaimer: rotational camera shake has horrifying / nauseating
# effects when used with godot's default parallax system. This is more or
# less because parallax layers don't respect camera rotation, only scroll
# offset.

# maybe this script shouldn't use process / force user to add camera
# script that calls it each frame? less obtrusive that way, dunno
# if it matters.

# don't forget to set camera as active
# don't forget to set camera rotating to true if you want rotational shake
