  Currently calibrating your sense of sight.
  Please look at the four dots.
  (mouse to look)
  (swipe transition for "opening your eyes")

pain
  Currently calibrating your sense of pain.
  please look at the spike.

  (spikes poke you and reveal health hud)

conveyer belt
  Currently calibrating your sense of adventure.
  Please look at the most imminent threat.
    (spikes)
    looking at spikes starts the conveyer belt

  more threats:
    doors that stay closed unless you look at them
    spike pits that close up while you are looking at them
    flamethrowers that turn off while you are looking at them

  look at different things to avoid getting torched or destroyed


conveyer belt dumps you onto your treads/wheels/feet, now you can move!
  Currently calibrating your sense of locomotion.
  Please proceed with all haste.
  (wasd or arrow keys to move)

  spike wall chasing you?
  hazards you can dodge by looking at them or by timing movement
